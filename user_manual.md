## How to install
0. Make sure you have installed Python3 correctlly.  
We recommend `python 3.11` or higher version. 
1. download and unzip the latest release from our github repo. 
2. use `pip install -r requirements.txt` or run `start.py` to install dependencies.

#### start.py guide
The following is a basic guide for using `start.py` to install dependencies.  
When you double click `start.py`, it should look like this image.  
![start_1](\proof_of_content\start_1.png)  
After entered 3 and press `enter` bottom, the program will install dependencies automatically.


If it shows like following image, it means that it couldn't find `requirements.txt` in corresponding path.  
To solve that, please download `requirements.txt` from our [Github repo](https://github.com/DaZuo0122/quant-st) and put it in right place.

## How to use
Note: For now, we highly recommend use `Steam_autotrade_cli` only.  
More detailed information can be found in user-interface.


For community developers, we recommend use `trade_strategy.py` directly as a python module instead of using user-interface `advance_trade.py` .  
Though trade logic in `trade_strategy.py` is not perfect, any kind of improvement is welcomed!  
You can upload your improvement by submitting PR at our [Github repo](https://github.com/DaZuo0122/quant-st).

### Get SDA info
Note: for current version, these info will be filled automatically.  
This guide is a backup.
To fill the `steam_account_info.json5`, you need to get SDA(SteamDesktopAuthenticator) info.  
Here is the guide!


Firstly, double click to run SteamDesktopAuthenticator.  
Haven't installed? click [here](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator)  
Once opened, it should look like this.  
![sda_1](\proof_of_content\sda_1.png)  
now click the second bottom.  
Once clicked, it should look like this.  
![sda_2](\proof_of_content\sda_2.png)  
enter username and pass words in the corresponding boxes.  


Then enter info required as following images show.


![sda_3](\proof_of_content\sda_3.png)


![sda_4](\proof_of_content\sda_4.png)


If you complete setting SteamDesktopAuthenticator, go to its corresponding path.  
And you can find a `.maFile` file.  
Open it with text editor(we recommend using np++ or vc)  
It should look like this in `vs code`  


![sda_5](\proof_of_content\sda_5.png)  

  
Finally, you can find the corresponding info to fill the `steam_account_info.json5`.

## FAQs
**Account security issues**  
All source code is open on GitHub for everyone to independently review code security.  
Unless the user's computer is compromised by malicious software, it is impossible for the account to be leaked.


**Why does the editor show a syntax error after I open the configuration file**  
This program uses a configuration file type called json5, so unsupported editors may show a syntax error, but it doesn't actually affect the program's execution.
